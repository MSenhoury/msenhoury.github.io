summary: Presentation of my AI model developed during Clinic'IA, focusing on sentiment analysis and NLP automation.
abstract: |
  In this talk at **BIG DATA & AI 2022**, I presented my **Machine Learning & Deep Learning-based Sentiment Analysis model**. 
  The model was developed as part of my work in **Clinic'IA**, leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI-driven automation**.

  The presentation covered:
  - **Fine-tuning Transformer-based NLP models**
  - **Building AI-powered sentiment analysis pipelines**
  - **Evaluating performance using real-world social media datasets**
  - **Deploying AI solutions for real-time text classification**

  This project demonstrates how **AI-driven text processing** can be used in industries such as **healthcare, finance, and customer analytics**.
